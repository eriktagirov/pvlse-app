              userDescription="I discovered yoga while working at an advertising agency in New York City. Seven years into my job, I was burnt out, disillusioned by the corporate world, and looking for something more meaningful. There was a studio next to the office where I began taking classes. It started with two days a week, but within six months, I was a daily student. I started leaving work early to get to my favorite teacherâ€™s classes, and very quickly, I realized my yoga was more important than my job."
